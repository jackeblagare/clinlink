# INTRODUCTION #

This project is an implementation of a web-based Clinic Management System that will help in clinical operations.

It will support the following features:

  * Appointment Registration and Queuing – provides the capability for prospective patients to book an appointment with a doctor in the clinic. It can also be used by the receptionist to review appointments or reschedule them to other timeslots or other doctors.

  * Patient Medical Records System – provides a system for easy management of the medical records of all the patients of the doctors in the clinic. It will allow doctors to easily review, edit, or add new records.

  * Patient Profile – allows a patient to view reminders pertaining to his treatment, prescriptions, his medical records, appointments, and billing reports.

  * Dashboard – central point where privileged users (doctors, nurses, receptionists) can perform administration operations that concern the Patient Medical Records System, Appointment Registration and Queuing, and Patient Profile.
